## Requirements

This website has exactly the same requirements as Jekyll. For more info please refer to [Installation - Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

## Run Locally

1. [Fork](https://github.com/sampan501/samapan.me/fork) or clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies with Ruby gem [`bundler`](https://bundler.io/) and Node.js package manager [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.org/).
3. Run `grunt init` to initialize your project.
4. Run `grunt serve` to fire up a local server.
5. Edit and customize your site.
6. Change Git remote to your own repo.
7. Push and deploy.

So in short:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/sampan501/samapan.me my-site
$ cd my-site
$ bundle install && yarn install
$ grunt init

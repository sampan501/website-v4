I have a wide array of experience, from using electrochemistry to understand neural systems at the
[Sombers Lab](https://www.somberslab.org/) in my undergrad at
[NC State](https://www.bme.ncsu.edu/) and to building tools that enable better data analysis
at [NeuroData](https://neurodata.io/) at [Johns Hopkins](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/)
via a [NIH Fellowship](https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/training-grants/T32-a)
These opportunities allowed me the pleasure to work on a wide variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a
daily basis.

When I'm not doing work, I like to read books and go on hikes!

## Abstract

Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is an endogenous molecule that plays several important roles in brain function: it is generated in cellular respiration, serves as a modulator of dopaminergic signaling, and its presence can indicate the upstream production of more aggressive reactive oxygen species (ROS). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD), creating a critical need to identify mechanisms by which H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> modulates cellular processes in general and how it affects the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway, in particular. Furthermore, there is broad interest in selective electrochemical quantification of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, because it is often enzymatically generated at biosensors as a reporter for the presence of nonelectroactive target molecules. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> fluctuations can be monitored in real time using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) coupled with carbon-fiber microelectrodes. However, selective identification is a critical issue when working in the presence of other molecules that generate similar voltammograms, such as adenosine and histamine. We have addressed this problem by fabricating a robust, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-selective electrode. 1,3-Phenylenediamine (mPD) was electrodeposited on a carbon-fiber microelectrode to create a size-exclusion membrane, rendering the electrode sensitive to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> fluctuations and pH shifts but not to other commonly studied neurochemicals. The electrodes are described and characterized herein. The data demonstrate that this technology can be used to ensure the selective detection of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, enabling confident characterization of the role this molecule plays in normal physiological function as well as in the progression of PD and other neuropathies involving oxidative stress.

## Abstract

The $$k$$-sample testing problem tests whether or not $$k$$ groups of data points are sampled from the same distribution. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) is currently the gold standard for $$k$$-sample testing but makes strong, often inappropriate, parametric assumptions. Moreover, independence testing and $$k$$-sample testing are tightly related, and there are many nonparametric multivariate independence tests with strong theoretical and empirical properties, including distance correlation (Dcorr) and Hilbert-Schmidt-Independence-Criterion (Hsic). We prove that universally consistent independence tests achieve universally consistent $$k$$-sample testing and that $$k$$-sample statistics like Energy and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) are exactly equivalent to Dcorr. Empirically evaluating these tests for $$k$$-sample scenarios demonstrates that these nonparametric independence tests typically outperform MANOVA, even for Gaussian distributed settings. Finally, we extend these non-parametric $$k$$-sample testing procedures to perform multiway and multilevel tests. Thus, we illustrate the existence of many theoretically motivated and empirically performant $$k$$-sample tests. A Python package with all independence and $$k$$-sample tests called hyppo is available from [https://hyppo.neurodata.io/](https://hyppo.neurodata.io/).
